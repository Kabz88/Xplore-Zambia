# Xplore Zambia  
A tourism website showcasing the beauty, culture, wildlife, and travel destinations of Zambia.

## Project Overview
Xplore Zambia is my first fully-built website project.  
It highlights Zambia’s landscapes, culture, eco-tourism opportunities, and major travel attractions.  
The site includes multiple pages, images, videos, and a responsive layout.

This project was created as part of my university coursework and as practice to improve my front-end development skills.
